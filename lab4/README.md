# Search Algorithms Implementation

This practical demonstrates the implementation of various search algorithms in Python. It includes linear search, binary search (both iterative and recursive), jump search, and performance comparison functions. Additional exercises explore further functionalities, like finding all indices of a target and counting comparisons.

## Features

- **Linear Search**: Iterates through each element in the list to find all occurrences of a target value.

- **Binary Search**: Uses a divide-and-conquer approach to find a target in a sorted list.

  - **Iterative Binary Search**: Non-recursive implementation.

  - **Recursive Binary Search**: Recursive implementation of binary search.

- **Performance Comparison**: Compares the execution times of linear and binary search algorithms.


- **Exercises**:
  - Modified linear search to return all indices of a target.
  - Binary search insertion point finder.
  - Counting comparisons for each search algorithm.
  - Jump search for fast search operations on sorted lists.
